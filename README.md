Here’s a quick breakdown of what I implemented:
 ✅ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform to provision VPC, EKS, ECR, EC2, IGW
 ✅ CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment
 ✅ Dockerized App with custom build and push to Amazon ECR
 ✅ GitOps Deployment using Helm and ArgoCD for continuous delivery to Kubernetes
 ✅ Self-hosted ArgoCD on EC2 with K3s for declarative deployment control
